## Create a Currency Converter using the Exchange-Rate API in JavaScript

  Live workshop with [Jad Joubran](https://jadjoubran.io/) in collaboration with [intechgration.io]().

  Project: [CurrencyPro Converter](https://learnjavascript.online/projects/currency-pro.html)

## Prerequisites

  - Create a free API key at [exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The API key that will be generated for you, will be a string in the following format: `45e31c9a2a1b6b0b8d6e1c2x`

  - Fork this repository

  - Study the [Figma Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/0fqg6mYPiyI7JVmKgbhADd/CurrencyPRO---Learn-JavaScript-Projects?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=OpefauhDrzUN5gZ0-1) and try to recreate them from scratch using HTML. In case you want to focus just on the JavaScript part, we have already included two HTML pages that can be used as a boilerplate. Check the `/html/` folder.
